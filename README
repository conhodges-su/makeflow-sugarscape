SUGARSCAPE + MAKEFLOW + WORKQUEUE

A project utilizing WorkQueue and Makeflow (from CCTools) to speedup execution times of a serial sugarscape implementation detailed here: https://github.com/nkremerh/sugarscape 

Requirements:
Bash
Python 3
TkInter

Usage:
python sugarscape.py

Makefile Options:
make local 
    This command runs a local-only makeflow using the ```.conf``` files in the ```/data``` folder of the repository.Ouput is placed in the folder specifed by `OUTPUTFOLDER`. Run folders should be renamed before running another set of jobs to collect information

make remote
    This command runs a WorkQueue-enabled job. You **must** change the the following command line arguments to run X # of workers
    - ```-w``` sets minimum workers in ```work_queue_factory```
    - ```-W``` sets maximum workers in ```work_queue_factory``` (we use the same to try and force equal workers throughout execution of a single run)
    - `-J` sets maximum number of concurrent makeflow processes at a time
    - `-M` sets the name of the project. We suggest using a name to indicate the # of workers subscribed

SUGGESTIONS
- use a ```>``` command to output terminal output to a designated file for long running jobs that may clear out your terminal if left unattended
- e.g. ```make remote > details.txt``` to output terminal commands to ```details.txt```
